                <p>Hi hiii, me Dramelon, ur fabulously pink dragon disaster-in-progress!</p>
                <p>I go by She/Her, but honestly I'll answer to anything as long as you say it with sparkles.</p>
                <p>Me basically a walking cotton-candy cloud with wings… except me yap yap yap instead of breathe fire, which is great until someone has to uhh... let's say not a kiss :p</p>
                <p>mee totally obsessed with tinkering with anything that beeps, boops, bleps, or looks like it might explode if me press "F5" to just run a silly program.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>raw raw from Thailand (GMT+7 ur time), and me birthday is March 6th... which means yes, me a pink derg with silly energy.</p>
                <p>If yuu ever need help with something warm and want to geek out, or just want someone who can unintentionally turn a computer into a loafin rug, I’m your dragon.</p>
